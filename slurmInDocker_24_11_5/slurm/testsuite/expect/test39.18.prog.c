/*
 * test39.18.prog <etc_dir> <nodename> <conf_gres> [<debug_level>]
 *
 * etc_dir	The directory containing slurm.conf, gres.conf, and
 * 		fake_gpus.conf.
 * nodename	The name of the node.
 * conf_gres	A string indicating the GRES ostensibly parsed from a
 * 		slurm.conf for the node. E.g., `gpu:4`.
 * debug_level	(optional) A number representing the log_level_t the program
 * 		should use. If unspecified, defaults to LOG_LEVEL_INFO.
 * 		LOG_LEVEL_INFO is the lowest log level allowed.
 * 		Note that debug, debug2, and debug3 may produce too much output
 * 		and cause expect to fail to parse things properly. This will
 * 		show up as a test failure. Only use debug+ when debugging and
 * 		developing tests, and NOT when running the tests in production.
 *
 * Note that slurm.conf only needs to specify the following fields:
 *	ControlMachine=test_machine
 *	ClusterName=test_cluster
 *	GresTypes=gpu,mps,nic,mic,tmpdisk
 *
 * The actual GRES for the node is specified in conf_gres, not slurm.conf. This
 * makes it so we don't need to re-create the slurm.conf each time we run this
 * test runner program.
 *
 * However, gres.conf and fake_gpus.conf do need to be re-created for each test.
