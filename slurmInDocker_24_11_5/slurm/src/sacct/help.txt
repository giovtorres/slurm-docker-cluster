sacct [<OPTION>]
     Valid <OPTION> values are:
     -a, --allusers:
                   Display jobs for all users. By default, only the
                   current user's jobs are displayed.  If ran by user root
                   this is the default.
     -A, --accounts:
                   Use this comma separated list of accounts to select jobs
                   to display.  By default, all accounts are selected.
     --array:
                   Expand job arrays. Display array tasks on separate lines
                   instead of consolidating them to a single line.
     -b, --brief:
                   Equivalent to '--format=jobstep,state,error'.
     -B, --batch-script:
                   Print batch script of job.
                   NOTE: AccountingStoreFlags=job_script is required for this
                   NOTE: Requesting specific job(s) with '-j' is required
                         for this.
     -c, --completion: Use job completion instead of accounting data.
         --delimiter:
                   ASCII characters used to separate the fields when
                   specifying the  -p  or  -P options. The default delimiter
                   is a '|'. This options is ignored if -p or -P options
                   are not specified.
     -D, --duplicates:
                   If Slurm job ids are reset, some job numbers may
                   appear more than once referring to different jobs.
                   Without this option only the most recent jobs will be
                   displayed.
     -e, --helpformat:
                   Print a list of fields that can be specified with the
                   '--format' option
     -E, --endtime:
                   Select jobs eligible before this time.  If states are
                   given with the -s option return jobs in this state before
                   this period.
         --env-vars:
                   Print the environment to launch the batch script of job.
                   NOTE: AccountingStoreFlags=job_env is required for this
                   NOTE: Requesting specific job(s) with '-j' is required
                         for this.
         --federation: Report jobs from federation if a member of a one.
     --expand-pattern: substitute wildcards in field name patterns
     -f, --file=file:
                   Read data from the specified file, rather than Slurm's
                   current accounting log file. (Only appliciable when
                   running the jobcomp/filetxt plugin.)
     -g, --gid, --group:
                   Use this comma separated list of gids or group names
                   to select jobs to display.  By default, all groups are
                   selected.
     -h, --help:   Print this description of use.
         --helpreason
                   Print a list of job reasons that can be specified with
                   the '--reason' option.
         --helpstate
                   Print a list of job states that can be specified with
                   the '--state' option.
     -i, --nnodes=N:
                   Return jobs which ran on this many nodes (N = min[-max])
     -I, --ncpus=N:
                   Return jobs which ran on this many cpus (N = min[-max])
     -j, --jobs:
                   Format is <job(.step)>. Display information about this
                   job or comma-separated list of jobs. The default is all
                   jobs. Adding .step will display the specific job step of
                   that job. (A step id of 'batch' will display the
                   information about the batch step.)
     --json[=data_parser]
                   Produce JSON output
     -k, --timelimit-min:
                   Only send data about jobs with this timelimit.
                   If used with timelimit_max this will be the minimum

     -K, --timelimit-max:
                   Ignored by itself, but if timelimit_min is set this will
                   be the maximum timelimit of the range.  Default is no
                   restriction.

                   Overrides --federation.
     -l, --long:
                   Equivalent to specifying
                   '--format=jobid,jobidraw,jobname,partition,maxvmsize,
                             maxvmsizenode,maxvmsizetask,avevmsize,maxrss,
                             maxrssnode,maxrsstask,averss,maxpages,
                             maxpagesnode,maxpagestask,avepages,mincpu,

                             tresusageoutave,tresusageouttot
     -L, --allclusters:
                   Display jobs ran on all clusters. By default, only jobs
                   ran on the cluster from where sacct is called are
                   displayed.
     -M, --clusters:
                   Only send data about these clusters. Use "all" for all
                   clusters.
     -n, --noheader:
                   No header will be added to the beginning of output.
                   The default is to print a header.
     --noconvert:
                   Don't convert units from their original type
                   (e.g. 2048M won't be converted to 2G).
     -N, --nodelist:
                   Display jobs that ran on any of these nodes,
                   can be one or more using a ranged string.
     --name:
                   Display jobs that have any of these name(s).
     -o, --format:
                   Comma separated list of fields. (use "--helpformat"
                   for a list of available fields).
     -p, --parsable: output will be '|' delimited with a '|' at the end
     -P, --parsable2: output will be '|' delimited without a '|' at the end
     -q, --qos:
                   Only send data about jobs using these qos.  Default is all.
     -r, --partition:
                   Comma separated list of partitions to select jobs and
                   job steps from. The default is all partitions.
     -s, --state:
                   Select jobs based on their current state or the state
                   they were in during the time period given: running (r),
                   completed (cd), failed (f), timeout (to), resizing (rs),
                   deadline (dl) and node_fail (nf).
     -S, --starttime:
                   Select jobs eligible after this time.  Default is
                   00:00:00 of the current day, unless '-s' is set then
                   the default is 'now'.
     -T, --truncate:
                   Truncate time.  So if a job started before --starttime
                   the start time would be truncated to --starttime.
                   The same for end time and --endtime.
     -u, --uid, --user:
                   Use this comma separated list of uids or user names
                   to select jobs to display.  By default, the running

     --units=[KMGTP]:
                   Display values in specified unit type. Takes precedence
                   over --noconvert option.
     --usage:      Display brief usage message.
     -v, --verbose:
                   Primarily for debugging purposes, report the state of
                   various variables during processing.
     -V, --version: Print version.
     -W, --wckeys:
                   Only send data about these wckeys.  Default is all.
     --whole-hetjob[=yes|no]:
                   If set to 'yes' (or no argument), then information about
                   all the heterogeneous components will be retrieved. If
                   set to 'no' only the specific filtered components will
                   be retrieved. The default behavior without this option is
                   that all components are retrieved only if filtering the
                   leader component with --jobs.
     -x, --associations:
                   Only send data about these association id.  Default is all.
